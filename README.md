# Final Fantasy 8 Triple Triad Advisor


## Introduction
The objective of this project is to emulate the mini-game triple triad from final fantasy 8 (PC, PS1) and than develop a function to return which is the best play in a given scenario.
It consists in a card game for two players, each with five cards, playing them one at a time, switching turns, on a board with 9 slots disposed on a grid 3x3.

A simple game: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fXADMoL8wbU

The cards are rectangular and have 4 numeric values, each value associated with each side. When a card is placed on a slot of the board, the numbers representing the adjacent sides of adjacents cards are used in a series of calculation, which depends on wich rules are turned on.
From these calculations the game determines which adversary card's you capture. Wins the game the player who ends up with most cards. There are several ways to capture the adversary card's.
Although simple in the beginning, this game add some complexity later on, and became really challenging. 


## To-Do
- Modify variables used to iterate over the board slots to stop relate to axis x and y, and relate to lines and columns
- Pass Slots by ID instead of numbers literals
- Function to iterate all possible plays in a given scenario


## Issues
### -Does "Same" event enable use de card values insted field values?
On this play https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=264wi-_Yxmw&t=64s Krysta card wouldn't be turned on my first undestanding. The '2-1 = 1' Phoenix right value wouldn't be able to turn the '1' value of Krysta card on slot 5. Apparently the Phoenix card captured Krysta Card using its '2' card's right value instead of the '2 - 1 = 1' value derived of the elemental mismatch. Further investigation needed.
